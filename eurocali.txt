Architecture descriptions could support design, simulation, and validation of SoS provided adequate formalism levels are chosen. In this study, we presented a comprehensive panorama about architecture descriptions for SoS revealing languages, quality attributes, and perspectives of use. In particular, we observe that more research is needed for effectively using architecture descriptions in the evaluation and evolution of SoS, which will require accurate, formal descriptions for predicting SoS emergent behavior. Thereby, we established a set of research lines to be addressed in future studies, including the establishment of architecture viewpoints framing important quality attributes for SoS and a consensus on the formalism level required at each stage of their life cycle. By indicating several opportunities for research, we expect this SLR can be used as a baseline for future studies concerning SoS architecture description.
